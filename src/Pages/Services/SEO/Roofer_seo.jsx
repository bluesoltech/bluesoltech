                <p className=' text-[1.1rem] leading-7 text-gray-500 text-start my-5'>When creating a website, it’s important to make sure that your URLs are SEO friendly. This means using keywords in your URLs, and making sure that they are easy to read and understand. One way to create SEO-friendly URLs is to use a system called mod_rewrite. With this system, you can create URLs that are both easy to read and understand, and that also contain keywords that will help improve your search engine ranking. Another way to create SEO-friendly URLs is to use a tool like Google’s Webmaster Tools. This tool allows you to choose a preferred URL for each of your pages, which can help improve your site’s ranking on Google.</p>

                <p className=' text-[1.1rem] leading-7 text-gray-500 text-start my-5'>Internal linking, also known as anchor text, is a technique used on the internet to create links from one web page to another. Anchor text is the clickable text within a hyperlink. When you click on an anchor text, it takes you to the web page that has been linked. Internal linking can be used for SEO purposes by creating links from one page of your website to another. This helps to improve the search engine ranking of your pages because it sends signals to the search engines that your pages are important and relevant. Internal linking can also help to keep visitors on your website longer, which can improve your website’s bounce rate.</p>
